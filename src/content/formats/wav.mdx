title: "WAV"
description: "The standard format in which all CDs are encoded. Great sound quality but it's uncompressed, meaning huge file sizes (especially for hi-res files). It has poor metadata support (that is, album artwork, artist and song title information). Commonly used as a wrapper format to store PCM format audio."
