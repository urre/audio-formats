title: "DSD"
description: "The single-bit format originally used for Super Audio CDs. It comes in 2.8mHz, 5.6mHz and 11.2mHz varieties, but
due to its high-quality codec, it‚Äôs (mostly) impractical for streaming. Uncompressed. DSD64 for this reason, with double and quadruple speed versions called DSD128 and DSD256 respectively. There's even a DSD512 spec."
