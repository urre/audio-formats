title: "FLAC"
description: "This lossless compression format supports hi-res sample rates, takes up about half the space of WAV, and stores metadata. It's  royalty-free and is considered the preferred format for  downloading and storing hi-res albums. The downside is, itâ€™s not upported by Apple (so not compatible with Apple Music). There
is also HDflac. The bit rates may be twice or even four times as high as normal FLAC, but the files are enormous."
